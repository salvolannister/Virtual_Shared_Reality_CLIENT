# Virtual Shared Reality CLIENT


This repository contains the application XListener created with unity 2018.8.8f1 for my master thesis in Computer Graphics developed in PucRio TecGraph and Politecnico of Turin, it enables a multiplayer experience between a user with a virtual reality headset (HTC Vive pro, oculus quest or rift) and a tablet/cellphone user.
